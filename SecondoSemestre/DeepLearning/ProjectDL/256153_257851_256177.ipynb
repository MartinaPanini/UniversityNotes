    "## Abstract\n",
    "This project addresses the challenge of few-shot adaptation in vision-language models, focusing on improving CLIP's performance on base classes while preserving its zero-shot generalization to novel categories. We propose a hybrid approach combining LoRA-based vision encoder adaptation with Tip-Adapter-F, a cache-based approach that stores features from the few-shot examples to enhance base-class predictions. An adaptive ensemble integrates predictions from the specialized LoRA-finetuned model and the original pre-trained model, dynamically balancing confidence between base and novel categories. Evaluated on the Oxford Flowers-102 dataset, our method demonstrates that LoRA specialization boosts base-class accuracy but reduces novel-class performance, while Tip-Adapter-F maintains transferability. The ensemble strategy effectively balances these trade-offs, achieving a 24.67% improvement in base-class accuracy (from 71.33% to 96.00%) and preserving novel-class accuracy (77.64%), yielding the highest harmonic mean (85.85%). Our results highlight the importance of integrating parameter-efficient adaptation with memory-based methods for robust few-shot learning in vision-language systems."

    "Large-scale vision-language models such as CLIP have demonstrated remarkable generalization capabilities in zero-shot image classification by leveraging contrastive learning on massive image-text pairs. However, their performance tends to decline in fine-grained tasks and few-shot scenarios, particularly when strong accuracy on base classes is required without degrading generalization to novel ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we tackle the **Few-Shot Adaptation** problem as define in project assignment. Specifically, we aim to improve classification accuracy on base categories from the Oxford Flowers-102 dataset using only the 10 labeled examples provided per class, while trying to preserve the model’s original zero-shot performance on novel categories. Therefore, our aim is to develop a final model that balance high accuracy on base classes and maintain strong generalization to novel classes, measured via their **harmonic mean**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this challenge, we propose a method that combines three complementary components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LoRA-based adaptation of the CLIP vision encoder**, enabling efficient and targeted updates to class-level vision embeddings while keeping the rest of the model frozen.\n",
    "- **Tip-Adapter-F**, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach that trains a lightweight MLP adapter on top of frozen CLIP image features to better align support image embeddings with their corresponding class prototypes.\n",
    "- **Ensemble scoring**, where we combine predictions from previous methods, yielding a final score that benefits from both. \n",
    "\n",
    "We evaluate our approach using three key metrics:\n",
    "1. CLIP zero-shot accuracy on **base classes**,\n",
    "2. CLIP zero-shot accuracy on **novel classes**, and\n",
    "3. The **harmonic mean** of the two, which reflects the trade-off between specialization and generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "These metrics form our baseline for comparison. The central objective of our work is to **maximize base class accuracy using only the provided few-shot data**, while **minimizing any drop in performance on the novel classes**."

    "**Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)** is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that constrains weight updates during adaptation to a low-rank subspace. It was introduced to address the high memory and computational cost of updating all parameters in large-scale pre-trained models such as CLIP.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theoretical Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Pre-trained deep networks, including transformer-based vision-language models, have weight matrices that are generally **full rank**. However, prior work (Aghajanyan et al., 2020) shows that such models often have a **low intrinsic dimension**, meaning that their learned representations and the space of useful adaptations occupy a much smaller subspace than the total parameter space.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This implies that during fine-tuning, the effective change in weights can be approximated by a low-rank update without significantly limiting the model’s ability to learn the new task. Instead of updating a large $d \\times k$ weight matrix directly, LoRA re-parameterizes the update as the product of two much smaller matrices:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "W = W_0 + \\Delta W, \\quad \\Delta W = BA\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $W_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times k}$ is the pre-trained weight matrix (frozen during adaptation), $B \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times r}$ and $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{r \\times k}$ are trainable matrices, and $r \\ll \\min(d, k)$ is the rank of the update. The rank $r$ controls the adaptation capacity: a small $r$ limits the expressiveness of the update but keeps parameter count low, while a larger $r$ allows more flexibility at the cost of increased parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In standard matrix multiplication, the output is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "h = W_0 x\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With LoRA, the forward pass becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "h = W_0 x + \\gamma \\cdot (B A x)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\gamma$ is a scaling factor applied to the low-rank update to stabilize training. $A$ is initialized, and $B$ is set to all zeros, ensuring $\\Delta W = 0$ at the start, so the initial output is identical to the pre-trained model. This initialization makes LoRA particularly stable in few-shot learning: at the beginning of training, the model performs identically to the base model, and adaptation happens gradually as $A$ and $B$ learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a typical CLIP transformer layer, the number of additional parameters introduced by LoRA with rank r, is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Params} = r \\cdot (d + k)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a small fraction of the full $d \\times k$ parameters. By freezing $W_0$, memory usage is reduced since no gradient storage is needed for frozen weights, overfitting risk is lowered in few-shot scenarios, and training is speed up while preserving most pre-trained knowledge.\n"

    "### Application to CLIP\n",
    "\n",
    "CLIP consists of a vision encoder and a text encoder, both implemented as transformer stacks with multi-head attention (MHA) modules. Each MHA block contains **query**, **key**, and **value** projection matrices, which are prime candidates for LoRA insertion. In our setup, LoRA is applied only to the vision encoder, while the text encoder remains frozen. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Details\n",
    "\n",
    "The Loraload function loads the original CLIP model, inserts LoRA modules into the vision encoder, marks only LoRA parameters along with positional_embedding and logit_scale as trainable, and keeps all other parameters frozen to maintain parameter efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fine-Tuning Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "The fine-tuning begins by reloading the CLIP ViT-B/16 model from scratch for a clean start, followed by LoRA injection into the vision encoder with rank $r = 8$. The training loop uses AdamW with a learning rate of $5 e^{-4}$ and cross-entropy loss for 15 epochs. For each batch, class names are tokenized into the format \"a photo of a {class_name}, a type of flower.\", images are encoded using the LoRA-adapted vision encoder, and text is encoded using the frozen text encoder. Features are normalized, cosine similarity logits are computed, targets are mapped to base-class indices, and loss is computed to update only LoRA parameters.\n",

    "### Why Only Vision-Encoder?\n",
    "\n",
    "We choose to apply LoRA only to the vision encoder because it provides the best trade-off between adaptation effectiveness and preserving CLIP’s strong zero-shot capabilities. The vision encoder extracts visual representations from images, so fine-tuning it allows the model to better capture task-specific visual patterns and adapt to the characteristics of the new dataset. Meanwhile, freezing the text encoder preserves the alignment between natural language prompts and class names, ensuring the model retains its robust zero-shot interpretability. This approach is also more parameter-efficient and computationally lighter compared to tuning both encoders, making training faster and more stable. Empirically, adapting just the vision encoder yields better results than tuning the text encoder or both encoders, improving base-class accuracy without sacrificing generalization to unseen categories."

    "Unfortunately, the initial fine-tuning results are strong on the base classes but show poor accuracy on the novel classes. This indicates that the model struggles to generalize beyond the base distribution, a phenomenon known as \"Catastrophic Forgetting\". To address this, we first attempted to implement an advanced strategy inspired by the paper \"Fine Tuning without Catastrophic Forgetting via Selective Low Rank Adaptation\" [5].\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea is to introduce a mechanism to selectively activate or deactivate LoRA modules. This is achieved by adding a learnable parameter, the lora_gate ($g_i$), for each LoRA module, which modulates its output:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "ΔW(x)=ΔW(x)⋅σ(g_{i})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "To encourage selectivity, a penalty is added to the main loss function, pushing non-essential gates towards zero:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "L_{total}=L_{original}+λ_{i}∑∣g_{i}∣\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Where $L_{original}$ is the standard cross-entropy loss and $λ$ is a coefficient that controls the strength of the penalty. \n",
    "During first attempts the penalty doesn't descrease during the training phase.\n",
    "This led us to a more sophisticated hypothesis: the issue might not be the magnitude of the coefficient, but rather the timing of its application. At the beginning of the training, the model has no information about which LoRA modules are useful. Imposing a strong penalty from the start would force the model to deactivate all modules as the safest strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "We therefore decided to allow the model an initial \"exploration\" phase. In our final implementation, we started the training with $λ=0$ for the first few epochs, and then gradually increased its value up to a maximum of 1.5 in the subsequent epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, our experiments showed that this improvement was not sufficient to mitigate the problem in our specific context. To address this, we explore additional techniques aimed at preserving performance on novel classes while maintaining or improving accuracy on base classes. Specifically, we apply Tip-Adapter [4], followed by a logit ensembling strategy combined with LoRA-based adaptation."

    "We build on a two-expert framework combining the strengths of the original CLIP model (the generalist) and a LoRA-finetuned CLIP model specialized for base classes (the specialist). This approach leverages Tip-Adapter-F, a cache-based method that enhances few-shot adaptation by storing and reusing features extracted from the training set, alongside an adaptive ensemble that dynamically weights predictions from both experts to optimize accuracy on both base and novel classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "The key idea behind Tip-Adapter-F is to construct a feature cache from the training images using the LoRA-finetuned model, which captures specialized representations for the base classes. At inference, the similarity between test image features and this cache is combined with zero-shot logits from the fine-tuned model to boost prediction confidence. This mechanism effectively integrates explicit memory of the training data into the model’s decision process, improving base-class performance without retraining.\n",
    "\n",
    "To maintain generalization on unseen (novel) classes, the original CLIP model’s zero-shot predictions are preserved as a complementary generalist expert. The adaptive ensemble blends the specialist (Tip-Adapter-F-enhanced fine-tuned model) and the generalist (original CLIP) by weighting their softmax probabilities with a parameter β that reflects confidence: higher weight is given to the specialist on base classes and to the generalist on novel classes. This dynamic weighting balances specialization with generalization, addressing the common challenge of base-to-novel trade-offs."

    "### Implementation Details\n",
    "#### Cache Creation:\n",
    "We create the Tip-Adapter feature cache by extracting normalized image embeddings from the LoRA-finetuned model over the base training set, saving both features and labels. This cache acts as a memory bank representing specialized knowledge acquired during fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adaptive Ensemble Evaluation:\n",
    "During evaluation, both the original and LoRA-finetuned models encode text prompts for the target classes to generate normalized text features. For each test batch:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The original model produces zero-shot image features, from which logits and softmax probabilities over classes are computed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The LoRA-finetuned model produces image features used for two predictions: zero-shot logits (similar to the original model) and cache-based logits derived from similarity between image features and the cached training features. These are combined with a scaling hyperparameter (tip_alpha) to form Tip-Adapter logits and probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If evaluating on base classes, the Tip-Adapter logits include cache information; for novel classes, the cache is ignored, relying solely on the fine-tuned model’s zero-shot predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The ensemble probability distribution is then calculated by interpolating between the generalist and specialist probabilities using β (higher β on base classes, lower on novel classes).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Final predictions are made by selecting the class with the highest ensembled probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy is computed for both base and novel test sets, and their harmonic mean is reported to quantify balanced performance across known and unknown classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method effectively leverages the LoRA fine-tuning for specialization while preserving CLIP’s original zero-shot generalization through adaptive ensemble weighting and cache-based memory augmentation."

    "When LoRA was applied to the vision encoder the model became better aligned with the training distribution and achieved strong results on the base classes, although in our experiments it failed to preserve Novel accuracy. This suggests that LoRA modifies the image embedding space too aggressively. The main problem likely lies in the fact that LoRA focuses purely on weight adaptation and does not involve prompt optimization. In few-shot scenarios with very limited data, this often leads to overfitting on Base classes and a consequent loss of performance on Novel classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, Tip-Adapter-F exhibited a different behavior. By relying on cache-based similarity with few-shot exemplars, it was able to retain robust recognition of novel classes. Yet this method lacked the same representational flexibility as LoRA, and therefore did not reach comparable accuracy on the base categories. What emerged was a complementary relationship: LoRA specialized strongly on the classes it adapted to, while Tip-Adapter-F preserved the model’s capacity to generalize more broadly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ensemble strategy brought these two perspectives together. By combining logits from LoRA and Tip-Adapter-F, the ensemble produced higher scores on both base and novel categories, ultimately achieving the best harmonic mean. This suggests that the hybrid approach acted as a balancing mechanism, drawing on LoRA to refine semantic alignment while relying on Tip-Adapter-F to prevent the system from collapsing into overfitting. The results therefore underline the importance of designing adaptation strategies that do not only maximize performance on seen data but also safeguard the model’s zero-shot abilities."

    "In this work, we examined parameter-efficient adaptation of CLIP for few-shot image classification on the Oxford Flowers102 dataset. Our experiments showed that applying LoRA to the vision encoder significantly increased accuracy on base categories but simultaneously reduced performance on novel ones, highlithing a strong overfitting and loss of generalization by the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "To balance this problem, we explored Tip-Adapter, which leverages a cache of few-shot exemplars to maintain performance on unseen categories. Although it does not reach LoRA’s level on base classes, its strength lies in preserving transferability. Finally, by combining LoRA and Tip-Adapter through logit ensembling, we obtained the most balanced results, achieving improved accuracy on both base and novel categories and thus the highest harmonic mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings suggest that no single parameter-efficient method fully resolves the trade-off between specialization and generalization. Instead, hybrid strategies that integrate complementary approaches provide a more effective path forward. Lots of future work are possible, such as investigate adaptive ensemble weights that adjust dynamically according to task difficulty or incorporate regularization mechanisms to mitigate overfitting in LoRA. Overall, our study underscores the value of combining lightweight adaptation with memory-based strategies to achieve efficient and robust few-shot learning in vision–language models.\n"
